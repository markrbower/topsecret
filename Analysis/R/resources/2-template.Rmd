This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

# Outline of Action

Make the Rmd document "live"; i.e., update and over-write it, continuously. It is not a journal or lab book. It is a living document that needs to be burned down, bulldozed and re-built on a daily basis. Posterity is for paper and pen. Get used to rewriting sections until they solidify over days. When a section achieves some stability, copy it into the Scrivener document.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
